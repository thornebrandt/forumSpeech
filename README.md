# forumSpeech

This is a Chrome Extension for making an TTS audio version of forums.

## Support

Currently supports reddit.

## Future Support

I plan to support twitter, disqus, slashdot, and facebook.
It needs to be frequently updated as these forums will have to 

## Installation

1. Clone the repo,
2. Navigate to chrome://extensions/ and choose 'Load unpacked extension' and select the repo folder.

## Development

1. Make sure you have installed the repo into chrome before running `npm install` and then `npm start`, because chrome doesn't like the node_modules folder but will continue to update if you develop after it is installed.
